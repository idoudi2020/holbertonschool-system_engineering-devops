- The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. When users type domain names such as www.google.com or www.foobar.com into web browsers, DNS is responsible for finding the correct IP address for those sites.

This all happens thanks to DNS servers: machines dedicated to answering DNS queries.
